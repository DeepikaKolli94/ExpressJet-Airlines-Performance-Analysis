# Data
We collected the data from U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics website which consists the information of the domestic flights operated by various airlines. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) publishes monthly information about airline on-time flight performance. The goal of the project was to visually analyze the performance of Express Jet airlines on the basis of: Daily or Monthly investigation on delayed flights, Average Monthly or Daily arrival and departure times, Average Monthly or Daily Delays in arrival and departure, Number of canceled flights and their reasons, Analysis on reasons of delays in flights, Total flight time with respect to its distance

Extracted the airline details for all the months of the year 2018 which were in 12 different csv files and each file consisted information of flights and their origin and destination airport, Departure and arrival statistics, Cause of Delays, etc. We concatenated all the data files into a single csv file using R Studio.
